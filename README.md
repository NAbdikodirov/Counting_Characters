# Counting_Characters

Write a program that contains the following GUI components:
A textarea that you can copy and paste text into.
A label that says "number of characters".
A text field  that displays the number of characters in the text in the textarea when the "count characters" button is clicked.
A Button that says "count characters" that counts the number of characters in the text in the TextArea when clicked and displays them in the textfield.
A button that says "reverse string" that reverses the string in the textarea.
Use an anonymous inner classes for each of your listeners. Follow the example in the Powerpoints.


This program does count the number of strings entered in the text section, and reverse it. The program can be helpful when you want to count the number of words in your essay
and it can be added a new function of counting the words, not only the characters. It also can be modified to check the essay, any means of writing by simply adding Grammarly or similar programms. Stay tuned for more!
